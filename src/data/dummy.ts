    summary: 'Learn the basics of reading your Kundli and understanding planetary influences on your life.',
    content: `A birth chart, also known as Kundli or Janam Patrika, is a celestial snapshot of the sky at the exact moment of your birth. This ancient Vedic tool provides profound insights into your personality, life path, and destiny.

The birth chart is divided into 12 houses, each representing different aspects of life:

1. First House (Lagna): Represents your personality, appearance, and overall approach to life
2. Second House: Governs wealth, family, and speech
3. Third House: Related to siblings, courage, and communication
4. Fourth House: Home, mother, and emotional foundation
5. Fifth House: Children, creativity, and education
6. Sixth House: Health, enemies, and daily work
7. Seventh House: Marriage, partnerships, and business
8. Eighth House: Transformation, longevity, and hidden matters
9. Ninth House: Higher learning, spirituality, and fortune
10. Tenth House: Career, reputation, and social status
11. Eleventh House: Gains, friendships, and aspirations
12. Twelfth House: Liberation, expenses, and foreign connections

The nine planets (headeragrahas) in Vedic astrology are:
- Sun (Surya): Soul, ego, and vitality
- Moon (Chandra): Mind, emotions, and mother
- Mars (Mangal): Energy, courage, and action
- Mercury (Budh): Intelligence, communication, and business
- Jupiter (Guru): Wisdom, spirituality, and prosperity
- Venus (Shukra): Love, beauty, and luxury
- Saturn (Shani): Discipline, hard work, and delays
- Rahu: Material desires and illusions
- Ketu: Spirituality and detachment

Understanding the placement and interactions of these planets in your birth chart can provide valuable guidance for making important life decisions.`,
